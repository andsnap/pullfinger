A GTK 3 based finger client implementation.

# Explanation

# Comparing Finger with HTTPS

Letâ€™s put the [Finger protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)) in perspective by comparing it with the modern HTTPS protocol:

    Finger Protocol:
        Origin: Developed in the early days of the internet when security concerns were less prevalent.
        Message Security: Transmits messages in plain text, making them vulnerable to snooping and eavesdropping.
        Privacy Measures: Lacks robust security mechanisms, making it unsuitable for handling confidential or private information.
        Usage: Used primarily for simple information retrieval between computers in the early internet era.

    HTTPS Protocol:
        Origin: Evolved to address the need for secure communication in the modern digital landscape.
        Message Security: Wraps messages in layers of encryption, ensuring that only intended recipients can decipher them.
        Security Measures: Utilizes digital certificates to verify the identity of servers and websites, enhancing trust and security.
        Usage: Widely employed for secure online transactions, protecting login credentials, and safeguarding sensitive data.

# Installation Guide

### Windows

We highly suggest you to install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (WSLg) and you can continue the reset of the process as for Linux.

Alternatively, you can install GTK library for Windows system and compile it. (Not recommended.)
